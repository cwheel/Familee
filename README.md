# Familee
**Familee won Fitbit's Best Use of Fitbit API Award!**

Wellness for the ones you care about, in a beautiful and elegant web app. Familee, our HackUMass 2015 submission, pulls data from connected Fitbit devices to keep relatives, care givers and family members informed about their older loved ones health. Familee looks at time spent walking and sleeping each day, as well as heart rate. Familee also attempts to infer when a love one is sick by combining all three data points into one, a 'sickness score'. Additionally, Familee uses Twilio to send text message alerts when it senses troubling health statistics. To top it off, Familee also supports texting medication reminders at pre determined times during the day.
